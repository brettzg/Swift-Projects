## Synopsis

This project was a project I built called "Bucket List Lab". The broader idea for this application would be to create lists or "categories" of ten things that a person could do in the place they chose to explore. There would be a system for either purchasing or earning (by sharing the app) new categories. Some examples of categories would be top 10 smoothie places in the area, top 10 most beautiful places in the area, or 10 interesting places to explore. It would be a combination between an exploring application and a social media application.

The current application lays down the basic framework to choose the city, category, and view the "tasks" or places to go. It also features a sharing function for facebook or twitter. Most of the idea could be completed by adding the coordinates/descriptions or additional places.

## Motivation

I created this application because it was an application that I would be interested in using. It also allowed me to get more experience in utilizing CLLocationManager and other location tools. I also wanted more experience with UI creation.

I got the idea for this application when I studied abroad in Barcelona, Spain. During my trip, they gave us a "bucket list" of a hundred things to complete before we left. It was fun, and I thought the idea could be expanded to any city.

## Future Iterations

Some features that could be included in the future to make this app better:

1. Continue adding cities, categories, and individual locations.

2. Allow user to suggest places to include in various cities that immediately emails the developer.

3. Introduce in-app purchases on categories screen that locks access unless purchased or "earned".

4. Allow user to share on instagram, and put in place system to unlock new categories by sharing.
