## Synopsis

This project was a project I built called "Gamify". The basic idea is users are able to create their own "games" or series of goals that they could mark off when acheived. The user can choose to create a game with a description. For each goal they decide to define, they can set a reward for completing it, a punishment if they don't complete it, and an achievement name and icon. When "playing the game", the user can view goals and mark off tasks when completed. All of this is maintained in storage on the user's device. Also, I set up a framework for the user to download other games that I enter internally.

## Motivation

I created this application because I thought it was an application that I would be interested in using. It also allowed me to get more experience in utilizing core data hierarchies, passing information between screens, and different design elements. 

## Future Iterations

Some features that could be included in the future to make this app better:

1. Set up a system for people to submit "games". The plan would also to be to include paid purchases in the downloads sections from professionals in particular areas. People would pay to get a list of tasks to complete certain objectives. 

2. Set up an achievement icon library when users accomplish certain tasks.

3. Add sound effects to make the experience better.
